# Introduction
This project requires the implementation of an experiment by obtaining the data and developing a classifier (in Python) that implements an ensemble architecture, following the 
procedures outlined in the article. Fulfilling all the models specified in the report are not required due to how challenging it is. As stated by the authors, the purpose of the paper is to see if using 
ensemble learning algorithms improves physical activity recognition accuracy compared to using single classifier algorithms.
# Requirements
Python program is the programming language used for this project. All code is built using a jupyter notebook.
