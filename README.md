# Machine-Learning-for-Data-Science
## Introduction
This repository is based on my data science master's degree program with Grand Canyon University. This course covers the application of analysis, design, and implementation of machine learning algorithms. The course aims to equip us with understanding the theoretical underpinning of both simple and advanced algorithms. At the end of each week, a python code, dataset, and written reports will be placed on each folder. So there are eight weeks of lectures for this course, and there are eight folders. 
## Requirements
Python program is the programming language used for this class. All code is built using a jupyter notebook.

##Installation
Python download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Anaconda download: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
