This is the application of a decision tree model to a dataset for people considering weather and traffic 
while deciding whether to commute by vehicle or public transportation, the data was collected for a 14 days period. The data have 
temperature, Wind, and Traffic-Jam as its attributes, and Car Driving Decision is the target 
variable.
