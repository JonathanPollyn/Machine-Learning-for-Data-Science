#Introduction
In this report k-means was used to answer some question about the data that was pulled from Kaggle from the education, universities, and college tag. The data frame has 777 observations and 18 variables. I choose the dataset since it is suitable for practice cluster analysis, data visualization, management, and predictions. Question that the k-means will be answering are which university have the highest graduation rate? Are private universities preferred to public university? How is the private university when compared to the public university?
